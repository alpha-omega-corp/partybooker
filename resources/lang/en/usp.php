    'text-1' => 'When an internet user looks to organize an event on the Web, an offer aggregator is the best platform to capture their attention in a few seconds, give them an overview, and stimulate curiosity. It is then crucial to position the unique advantages of each partner (Catering, Entertainment, Hotelâ€¦). Our web designers create your visual identity, so that your web image is harmoniously adapted across different media or devices (large screens, tablets, mobiles). This is referred to as responsive design, or in French, adaptive web sites. This technique is perfectly mastered by Partybooker.',

    'title-2' => 'Peek customer\'s intrest',
    'text-2' => 'The degree of correlation perceived by your visitors between, on one hand, what they are currently searching for, and on the other hand, what your website offers is crucial. A Google surfer poses a specific question. When they land on a site, they will evaluate in a few seconds if its content matches what they are looking for. The challenge is to know how to retain visitors within 10 seconds statistically (Retention Rate). The spatial organization of your content is the core of what we call semantic ergonomics, and it is one of the strengths of Partybooker.',

    'title-3' => 'From anonymous visitors to customers',
    'text-3' => 'Your website should include a commercial section that presents your services, in order to achieve the best possible conversion rate. It should describe what you do and why you do it better or differently than your competition. Partybooker achieves this goal by providing a targeted platform.',

They might come through a Google search, an AdWords advertisement, social media, a link in an email, or by knowing your site and returning directly by typing your domain name. That is why your web strategy must include a traffic acquisition strategy, and this discipline is at the heart of Partybooker.',

    'title-5' => 'Grow your audience',
    'text-5' => 'The visibility effort of Partybooker is designed with its target audience in mind. This is what we call an audience. The contents of Partybooker are different from those of your main website (purpose of the visit, keywords, graphic codes, ergonomics, preferences) to adapt to the specific targeted audience. Partybooker complements your digital visibility.',

    'title-6' => 'The advantages of a website rich in information',
    'text-6' => 'Partybooker, with its numerous pages of content, has a high conversion rate. This wealth of information and ideas, where your expertise and concepts are shared, multiplies your commercial impact. To achieve this result, you would need to invest huge resources, which would divert you from your core business.',

    'title-7' => 'Time saver',
    'text-7' => 'By offering your clients or prospects an easy way to find the information they need, you optimize your internal resources and save on recurring questions.',

    'title-8' => 'Return on investment',

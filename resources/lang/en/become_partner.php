		<p><b>1. A professional image</b></p>
		<p>When a user searches for an event on the Web, an offer aggregator is the best platform to capture their attention in seconds, to give them an overview and stimulate curiosity. It is then crucial to position the unique advantages of each partner (Catering, Animation, Hotel ...).
Our web designers create your visual identity, so that your web image is harmoniously available on different medias or terminals (large screens, tablets, mobiles). We are talking about \"responsive design\". This technique is perfectly mastered by Partybooker.
</p>

		<p><b>2. Generate interest</b></p>
		<p>The degree of correlation perceived by your visitors between, on the one hand, what they are looking for and, on the other hand, what your website offers is crucial. A Google surfer is asking a specific question. When it lands on a site, it will evaluate in a few seconds if its content corresponds to what it seeks. The challenge is to know how to keep visitors in 10 seconds statistically. (Retention rate).
The spatial organization of your content is the heart of what we call semantic ergonomics and it is one of the strengths of Partybooker.</p>

		<p><b>3. From anonymous visitors to customers; conversion</b></p>
		<p>Your website must have a commercial part that shows your services, in order to have the best possible conversion rate. It presents what you do, why you do it better or different than your competition.
Partybooker in bringing a targeted platform achieves this goal.</p>

		<p><b>4. Visibility</b></p>
		<p>A site well referenced on Google is an extraordinary way to generate leads and the SEO is pricy. A visitor never comes by chance. It can happen through a Google search, an AdWords ad, social media, a link in an email or know your site and return directly by typing your domain name. This is why your web strategy must include a traffic acquisition strategy and this discipline is at the heart of Partybooker.</p>
		
		<p><b>5. Develop your audience</b></p>
		<p>Partybooker's visibility effort is based on its target audience. This is what we call an audience. Partybooker content is different from your main website (purpose of the visit, keywords, codes, ergonomics, preferences) to adapt to the specific targeted audience. Partybooker complements your digital visibility.</p>
		
		<p><b>6. The benefits of a website rich in information</b></p>
		<p>Partybooker with its many content pages has a high conversion rate. This affluence of information, ideas, your expertise, your concepts are shared and raises your commercial impact. To achieve this result, you would need to invest huge resources, which would distract you from your core business.</p>
		
		<p><b>7. Saving time</b></p>
		<p>By providing your customers or prospects with easy access to the information they need, you can optimise your internal resources and save recurring questions.</p> 
		
		<p><b>8. Conclusion: Return on investment</b></p>
		<p>Partybooker is an investment that pays off very easily</p>",
